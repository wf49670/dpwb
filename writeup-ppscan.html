  <h2 class='rf'>Workbench Component: ppscan</h2>

  <p>This program provides a state-machine based search of a text file
    looking for unexepected curly quote sequences. For example, it knows
    not to expect an open double quote immediately after an open double
    quote if there isn't an intermediate paragraph break. Checks using
    a local context miss this type of error. The program currently
    generates many false positives, but the errors it does find are
    elusive and usually not findable using other methods. Provide
    ppscan a UTF-8 text file with curly quotes.</p>

    <p>The ppscan program runs a state-based scan for punctuation on a text file that
    has been prepared for submission to Project Gutenberg. It is
    checking the curly quotes, so the file should be UTF-8 with curly
    quotes. The user uploads a text file, chooses any options to
    override deafults and clicks Submit. After the prgoram has analzyed
    the file, it presents a link to the results for the user to download
    or view. In that file,
    <span style='color:red'>search for the "@" symbol</span>,
    which marks where
    the program thinks there might be a problem. Usually you can spot a
    problem or a false positive quickly. If you need to know more about
    what the program questioned, there is a list of errors, including
    the description, at the end of the results file.</p>

    <p>Some users prefer a more complete error message at the point where
    the error was detected. If the user chooses the "extended report
    format" instead of a single "@" they will get an error like [@CODQ]
    saying not only that there is a suspected error but that it is a
    "consecutive open double quote" error. The complete list is printed
    at the end of the report file for reference. </p>
