  <h2 class='rf'>Workbench Component: Ppgutc</h2>

  <p>Ppgutc runs extensive checks on a text file that has been prepared for submission
  to Project Gutenberg. The user uploads a text file, clicks Submit, and then downloads
  or views the results text file.</p>

  <p>After a run, each report shows a test number along with reports for that test. Usually
    the first five reports of any type are reported.
    Users can also select "Show all reports" to request ppgutc show <em>all</em> suggested errors. This option also lists all tests that were run, even if no errors were reported.</p>

    <p>Please Note: Ppgutc and its ancestor, gutcheck, have very basic
      he/be, had/bad and hut/but checks. However, these cannot be relied on especially
      for the he/be checks. It is strongly recommended that you run ppjeeb, a Python
    port of jeebies, for he/be checks in addition to the ppgutc checks.</p>
