  <h2 class='rf'>Workbench Component: Ppspell</h2>

  <p>Ppspell runs an intelligent spellcheck on a text file. It uses a combination
    of filtering hueristics backed by the aspell dictionaries for English and several
    other languages.</p>

    <p>If a single, unzipped file is uploaded a straightforward spell-check is
      completed. Suspect words are presented with line numbers and context. Users
      with an available project Good Word List can improve the accuracy of the
      check by creating a Zip file containing the text file and the good
      words in a file named good_words.txt. Ppspell will use a good_words.txt
      file if it finds one.</p>
