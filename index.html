<p style='text-align:center; background-color:#FFFFAA'>This is a test page for the post-processors' Workbench.</p>

<p>In a small town in Nebraska, the Alliance Hotel was a temporary home to many
commercial travellers. In the lobby was a small library. To make the travellers' stay
more enjoyable, a list of "Who's Who and Where" for the town was pasted inside
the front cover of the books in the library.</p>

<p>I was taken by the simplicity of it all. The Bank's phone number was two
digits: 79. The Vaudeville and Photoplays listing sounds like fun. But if the
visitor wants to relax and thoroughly enjoy reading a book, the only phone number
they needed was Homer Wilson's. You'll find it—and why—at the bottom of the
page.</p>
