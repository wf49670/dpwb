DP Post Processor Workbench

This is a set of tools used in the final stage of ebook production: post-processing. It consists of a user-visible page (dpwb.php), a form handling page (dpwb-action.php) and a series of programs for the individual tests. All programs are written in Python3 or Go. Once the user asks the workbench to run the tests, each test contributes to a report that is presented back to the user for viewing or download.
